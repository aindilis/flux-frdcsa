%% This file must implements predicate search
%% search(+InitState, +GoalState, -Solution)
%%   InitState has an arbitrary definition.
%%   GoalState
%%   Solution is a list of actions obtained from ActionDef of predicate step.
%%  
%% Following predicates may be used:
%%   step(+State, -ActionDef, -NewState)
%%     During backtracking generates all possible descendants.
%%
%%   is_goal(+State) - is true when State is a goal state.
%%
%%   h(+State, +Value) - is estimated distance to the goal state.
%%
%%   repeating(+State, +AnotherState) - is true when two states are equal.
